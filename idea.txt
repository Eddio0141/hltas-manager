> cfg
	- init-git: initialzes a git repo on new projects

> commands
- install
	- do we dl the "special dll" for the simulator client?
	- creates a tas folder if it doesn't exist
	- creates a default cfg file

- new <project name> <game name> <copy for sim client>
	- if cfg file doesn't exist, it will tell the user to run install
	- creates a folder with project name
	- initializes a git repo by default but --no-git will prevent that
		- gitignore
			- batch files
	- creates a hook with the hardlink script
	- if game name is set and game has cl_dlls/client.dll
		- if copying for sim client, copy the whole folder of the mod and create a "new" mod just for the simulator client without the client dll
		- if not copying for sim client create disable_vanilla_game enable_vanilla_game batch file for client dll resets
	- creates a run_game batch file
		- if game name is present, will run hl with that game in argument
		- if game name is empty, will run vanilla hl
		- if game name doesn't exist as a folder, error
		- detects if rinput exists, and puts that in the thing to run, but has rinput running commented out if it doesn't exist
		- if copy for sim client is true, running the simulator client with this will run the other game
	- create link_hltas_files script
	
- init <folder name>
	- initializes stuff like above but on an existing folder

- games
	- tries to list all games present
